# awesome-transfer-learning
A list of awesome papers and other resources on transfer learning and domain adaptation! Don't hesitate to suggest some resources I could have forgotten.

## Papers

Papers are ordered by theme and inside each theme by publication date (submission date for arXiv papers).

### Surveys

* A Survey on Transfer Learning (2009) (\[Paper]\)[https://www.cse.ust.hk/~qyang/Docs/2009/tkde_transfer_learning.pdf]
* Domain Adaptation for Visual Applications: A Comprehensive Survey (2017) (\[arXiv]\)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05374.pdf]

### Adversarial Domain Adaptation

* Adaptative Discriminative Domain Adaptation (2017) (\[arXiv\])[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.05464.pdf]
* Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation using Cycle-Consistent Adversarial Networks (2017) (\[arXiv\])[https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.10593]
* Learning to Discover Cross-Domain Relations with Generative Adversarial Networks (2017) (\[arXiv\])[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.05192.pdf]

## Datasets

### Images

* [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) vs [SVHN](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/) vs [USPS](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multiclass.html#usps)

## Libraries

No good library for the moment. If you're interested in a project of creating a generic transfer learning/domain adaptation library, please let me know.
